## General Information
- This project is for training a cnn model to make it accuractely detect melanoma disease, melanoma disease is a type of skin cancer.
- This project provides the solution where the cnn model can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma thereby reducing a lot manual effort required for diagnosis
- For this project we will be training 3 cnn models where each subsequent cnn model will be an improved version of the previous cnn model.
- The dataset used for training the model consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)


## Conclusions
- With the increase in number of convolutional layers and greater number of filters the accuracy of the cnn model increases significantly.
- By using dropout and batch normalization in the model we can prevent overfitting of the model.
- Imbalanced dataset leads to decrease in validation accuracy as the dataset gets balanced the accuracy on the unseen images increases.



## Technologies Used
- tensorflow - version 2.17.1
- matplotlib - version 3.8.0
- numpy - version 1.26.4
- pandas - version 2.2.2


## Acknowledgements
- This project was an assignment by Upgrad to strengthen the cnn concepts.
- The model training in this project is done on the dataset formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
